Please extract the datasets to a folder called 'datasets' before running the program.

The main.py provides the interface to train, test/eval CNN and CAE models.

The parameters (such as momentum, learning rate) are fixed to the optimal values obtained by cross validation.

The Jupyter notebooks are used to find optimal parameters by cross validation.
